Computer Programming 12 – Digital Storefront Project Challenges 

Instructions: You have just been hired on to work for a startup company that wants to run a digital storefront for their business. A previous coder created a prototype storefront, but it is missing functionality the company wants to make the experience better for the user and to be able to handle more inventory and complexity! It is your job to add as many new features as you are able! Your score on this project relates to both how many challenges you can complete as well as the difficulty of challenges you solve. 

Challenges to complete organized by difficulty: 

Tier 1 (Basic)   ALL REQUIRED 

Add exception handling to all relevant menus to prevent the user from breaking cod logic 

Add a new class of Buyable items to the store and pre-populate the store with at least 5 unique items in the categories inventory. Integrate your new buyable class into the menus and data management for your shopping cart. 

Tier 2 (Involved) and Tier 3 (Advanced)    YOUR CHOICE (refer to rubrics for more guidance) 

Improve the Store class’ viewCatalog() method to provide the user a menu to choose which sub-catalog they want to view individually. 

Advanced: Provide the user another menu to choose which specific item they want to view more details about individually. 

 

Improve the reviewMyStuff() method, which pulls data from the list that contains all of the items you have bought, to contain a lot more functionality. Instead of just reporting everything the user has bought all at once, provide a more customized experience that gives the user more choice and information when reviewing their stuff. Hint: You may need to adjust how the user’s bought items are stored and tracked to provide access to certain information. 	 	  

Advanced: Create the menuing needed for the user to view any detail of every item they own. Hint: Use methods to create sub-menus for categories of things. 	 

 

 

Improve the StoreInventory class in the following ways: 

Instead of just removing bought items completely, create a separate database to keep track of items that have been sold (give it a memory). 

Advanced: Provide the user with the ability to viewRecentPurchases(), which should report the 3 (or fewer) most recent items they bought in the store. Hint: you will need to add content to the Store class’ menu to give the user access to this tool. 

 

Add a 4th (or more) main menu option for the user where it says “YOUR CUSTOM IDEA HERE”. This should add a unique piece of functionality to the shopping experience that you custom-build. Some examples of things you can consider adding: 

The ability to return items back to the store.  

Advanced: You can only return the most recent 3 purchases. 

The ability to haggle to buy items at a lower price. This could be a preset amount, or …  

Advanced: Each haggle attempt randomly generates a discount that would be acceptable that gets less forgiving with each failure. 

The ability to access the store’s database as an ‘Administrator’ and add custom items to its inventory while the program is running.  

Advanced: Require the user to login as admin from the start of the program and only show that menu option if that is the account they log in under. 

Add a custom idea! You must clear the concept with me before creating it! 

 

Documenting Your Changes 

As you work, please document each significant change you make to the code below so that I know specifically where to look to give you credit for your work. For example, you could list the challenge(s) you completed. In addition, if you made any improvements to the code outside of the challenges you think you might deserver some credit for, summarize them to me below! 

 

 

Assessment 

For this project, you will be graded on two rubrics: one for the complexity of challenges you successfully complete and another for the quality of the code that solves these problems. 

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all higher score tiers require lower tiers to be completed to be reachable. 

 

 

Complexity of Solutions 

You must complete the content in both columns to receive the given score range.

Score 

Quality of Code 

Assessing the organization, naming, spacing, and commenting of your code. 

0 - 1 

Code is immensely sloppy, unreadable, and disorganized below minimum standards. 

2 – 3 

Code is sloppy, insufficient, and disorganized in all categories, but above a passing level. 

4 - 5 

Code struggles with issues on 1 or 2 categories, but is competent in others. 

6 

Overall, code is highly competent in quality but struggles with consistency or a 7/8 score with no comments! 

7 

Overall, code is written with a consistent and high quality; minor mishaps or oversights. 

8 

All added code is high-quality in all required categories.
