 * (Edited by Rylan Raj (Computer Programming 12))
 * Tier 1 has been fully solved, all menus have exception handling along with 5 new buyable items made with the new
 buyable furniture class
 * A Tier 2 problem has been solved, the view catalog method now divides into sub-catalogs
 * A Tier 3 problem has been solved, the shopper has the option to view an individual items details
 * A Tier 2 problem has been solved, stores database can be accessed as an administrator and add custom items
 * A Tier 3 problem has been solved, AdminTools can only be used if the user uses an admin account
 * A Tier 2 problem has been solved, items can now be returned to the store
 * A Tier 3 problem has been solved, only the last 3 purchased items can be returned to the store
 * A Tier 2 problem has been solved, the admin now has access to a database of all sold items
 *
 * I believe that I have fully solved these problems
 * In addition, I also fixed the shopping cart system so that the user can remove items from their cart
 * I also gave the admin accounts the ability to change the amount of money in other accounts
 These fixes don't count as tier problems, but I thought I would include them here so that you know about them.

 *
 * In total, I have believed to have fully solved 3 tier 3 problems and 4 tier 2 problems, and have fully
 solved tier 1, along with implementing and fixing systems from the original code
